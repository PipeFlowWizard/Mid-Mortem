### Summary

Set within a plane between life and death, in a realm known as Elysium, the Reaper exists to guide the souls of dead animals to the afterlife. However, a darkness has overtaken the realm, infecting the Guardians of Elysium and corrupting the departed souls. Being the only one unaffected, the Reaper must save the Guardians from the darkness and lead the corrupted souls to rest. Based on the early Legend Of Zelda games, Mid Mortem includes some of the classic dungeon delving mechanics adults grew up with, now targeted to a younger audience. The Player explores different biomes, fighting enemies, reaping souls for power ups, and finding the key to unlock the next stage. Mid Mortem offers a nice balance of adventure gameplay and casual action, all in a low poly and cute tone to introduce young gamers to the classic mechanics we know and love. 

This game was created as the team project for the class COMP-376: Introduction to Game Development at Concordia University (Montreal, QC, Canada)
